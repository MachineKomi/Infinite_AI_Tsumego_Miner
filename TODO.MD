# Human TODO:

1. Put KataGo folder and contents back in assets
2. Redownload and re-rename all of the KataGo networks/models and put them in assets/models
2.1 See the readme in the models folder for the file names and networks to download
3. Remember never to trust Opus 4.5 with anything related to Git (because it might delete my actual local files from the repo irrecoverably)
4. Continue development and start testing
